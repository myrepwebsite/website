                <h2>Viewing Homes</h2>
                <h3>The Home Shopping Process</h3>
                <p>As your real estate agent, my most important job is to make the home shopping process pleasant and rewarding for you. I do that in a number of ways.</p>
                <ul class="selling2-list">
                    <li>I regularly recommend properties for viewing that closely match your needs and wants, and are within your price range. That spares you the frustration of visiting homes that aren’t suitable.                    </li>
                    <li>I make sure you don’t miss opportunities. When a desirable property suddenly comes on the market, you’re alerted.                    </li>
                    <li>I help you schedule viewings that fit your schedule, so there’s little if any inconvenience for you.                   </li>
                    <li>Before you view a property, I provide you with in-depth details on the home, so you can make an informed decision. This includes closing dates, market value, and more. Later, if you have questions, I get the answers for you.                    </li>
                    <li>I also give you the scoop on the neighbourhood, so you get a clear sense of what an area is like in terms of lifestyle, safety, schools, etc.                    </li>
                    <li>When you find a property you like, I give you my honest, professional recommendation as to how well the home meets your needs and wants. You won’t have to make such an important decision without my expert advice.                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As your real estate agent, I’m committed to getting you into the right home, and I’m with you every step of the way.                </p>

                <h3>What to Look for When Viewing a Property</h3>
                <p>Here are a few questions and ideas to consider when viewing homes to help make the process easier and more productive:                </p>
                <ul class="selling2-list">
                    <li>Does the home have your “needs” features (those features you must have)? (For example, number of bedrooms, closet space, kitchen size, etc.)                    </li>
                    <li>Does the home have any of your “wants” features (those features you’d like to have but would be willing to forgo)? (For example, large backyard deck, spacious family room, etc.)                    </li>
                    <li>What is the general condition of the home? (Are there signs that the owners have kept up with repairs and maintenance?)                    </li>
                    <li>Will the home need any major repairs, remodeling or renovations? Is there anything, such as the furnace, that may need to be replaced soon?                    </li>
                    <li>Is there anything about the home you don’t like? Can that be changed with a remodeling or renovation now or in the future?                    </li>
                    <li>Take a walk around the neighbourhood. Are the homes well-kept, indicating pride of ownership?                    </li>
                    <li>Do you like where the home is situated in the neighbourhood?                    </li>
                    <li>Does the neighbourhood have what you want? (For example, access to public transit, shopping, local parks, etc.)                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Viewing properties should never be a frustrating ordeal. It’s my job to help make the process easy and productive for you, so you can find the home you want.                </p>
